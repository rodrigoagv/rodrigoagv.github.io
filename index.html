<h2>About me</h2> 
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p> I was born in September 24th, 1992 in Viña del Mar, Chile. In November 2016 I received the MSc. in Electronic Engineering 
  degree with a major in Automatic Control, together with my Electronics Engineering degree, at <a href="https://usm.cl/"> Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María</a>  
  (UTFSM) in Valparaíso, Chile.
</p> 
<p> My MSc. Thesis was on "Enforcement of causality and passivity in spectral analysis", and was supervised by Dr. Ricardo Rojas from UTFSM along with Dr. 
  Cristian Rojas and Dr. Patricio Valenzuela from <a href="http://www.kth.se">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> in Stockholm, Sweden (KTH).  
</p>  
   <p> On October 2017, I began my Ph.D. studies at KTH under the supervision of Cristian R. Rojas . My main interests are among the areas of system identification, 
     signal processing, and control theory.
    </p> 
<p> Among other interests, I enjoy running, playing soccer and chess. I also like playing guitar (acoustic and electric), bass (fretted and fretless), and keyboards. 
  I speak English fluently and Spanish is my native language.
    </p>

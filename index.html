<h2>About me</h2> 
  <div id="demobox">
<p> I was born in September 24th, 1992 in Viña del Mar, Chile. In November 2016 I received the MSc in Electronic Engineering 
  degree with a major in Automatic Control, together with my Electronics Engineering degree, in <a href="https://usm.cl/"> Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María</a>  
  (UTFSM) in Valparaíso, Chile.
</p>  
<p> My MSc Thesis (written in Spanish) is named "Enforcement of causality and passivity in spectral analysis", and was supervised by Ricardo Rojas, together with Cristian 
  Rojas and Patricio Valenzuela from KTH. 
</p>  
   <p> On October 2017, I began my PhD studies with Cristian R. Rojas at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. My main interests
    are among the areas of system identification, signal processing, and machine learning. I have also done research in control over networks.
    </p> 
<p> Among other interests, I enjoy running (10k-21k), playing soccer and chess. I also like playing guitar (acoustic and electric), bass (fretted and fretless), and keyboards. 
  I speak English fluently and Spanish is my native language.
    </p>

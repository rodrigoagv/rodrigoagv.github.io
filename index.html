<h2>About me</h2> 
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p> I was born in September 24th, 1992 in Viña del Mar, Chile. In November 2016 I received the MSc. in Electronic Engineering 
  degree with a major in Automatic Control, together with my Electronics Engineering degree, at <a href="https://usm.cl/"> Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María</a>  
  (UTFSM) in Valparaíso, Chile.
</p> 
<p> In October 2017, I began my Ph.D. studies at KTH under the supervision of Cristian R. Rojas. I successfully defended my Ph.D. Thesis in May 2022, with title "Continuous-time System Identification: Refined Instrumental Variables and Sampling Assumptions". My main interests are among the areas of system identification, 
     signal processing, and control theory.
    </p> 
<p> Among other interests, I enjoy reading, running, playing soccer and chess. I also like playing guitar (acoustic and electric) and bass (fretted and fretless).
